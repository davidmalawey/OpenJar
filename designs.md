**Key Features:**
- Threaded for secure attachment.
- Sealed for airtight or watertight performance.
- Textured grip for improved handling.
- Ergonomic shape derived from a revolved profile.

Unlike the Mason Jar cap, this bottle cap is tailored to bottle-specific applications, maintaining a clear design intent for various use cases.
