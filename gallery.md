Gallery Purpose: quickly preview various branches of the design project, discover designs that suit your interest.  Also note:
* Each design should have it's own images published together with design information, and with the posted CAD files.
* However, we also want to show viewers our newer ideas, our designs undergoing testing, or other pictures that don't yet have a full documentation.
* For the designers, the gallery is a place to share ideas that are not fully ready, which is more than the designs that are complete.
