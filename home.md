**Openjar Project** is an open-source Hardware Design.

## Mission  
We aim to make open hardware as accessible and collaborative as open-source software. Our mission is to:  
- Encourage sustainability by repurposing common items, such as mason jars.  
- Provide parametric designs for flexibility and customization.  
- Develop a robust open-source ecosystem where contributions are straightforward and impactful.

## Why?
We want to impact the world and we started with a humble jar.  Why?  Because simple designs leave space for innovations in the design process.  There is nothing new about the jar and everything new about the collaboration, documentation methods, and intentionality of the project.
This project aims to transform open-source hardware by focusing on:  
- Parametric models for flexibility.  
- Comprehensive documentation to improve collaboration.  
- Fully digital designs to facilitate widespread contributions.

Our goal is to empower hardware designers to collaborate as seamlessly as software developers.

**Adapter Threads**  
The adapter thread system enables modularity and easy printing without supports. Each adapter consists of two parts: the lid adapter and the thread component.

**Spray Bottle Adapter**  
Uses `lid_adapt.stl` and `thread_spray.stl`.

**Foamy Dispenser Adapter**  
Uses `Lid_foamy.stl` and `thread_foamy.stl`.

**Rubber Seal for Food Storage**  
For food storage, consider using a silicone rubber seal such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TY28LZV).

## Sizes  
Ensure the jar mouth adheres to standard dimensions.
