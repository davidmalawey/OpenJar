**Our Mission** üõ†Ô∏è  
We believe in making open hardware as accessible and collaborative as open-source software. Our mission is to:  
- Encourage **sustainability** by repurposing common items like mason jars.  
- Offer **parametric designs** for ultimate flexibility and customization.  
- Build a robust **open-source ecosystem** where contributions are simple and impactful.

## **Why OpenJar?** üí°

This project aims to transform open-source hardware by focusing on:  
- **Parametric models** for flexibility.  
- **Comprehensive documentation** for better collaboration.  
- Fully **digital designs** to empower contributions.  

> Let's empower hardware designers to collaborate as seamlessly as software developers. Cheers to a new paradigm of open-source hardware! üéâ

 **Adapter Threads** üîß  
The adapter thread system allows modularity and easy printing without supports. Each adapter consists of two parts: the **lid adapter** and the **thread component**.

 **Spray Bottle Adapter**  
Uses `lid_adapt.stl` and `thread_spray.stl`.

**_Figure:_** Spray bottle assembly.

 **Foamy Dispenser Adapter**  
Uses `Lid_foamy.stl` and `thread_foamy.stl`.

 **Rubber Seal for Food Storage** üç¥  
For food storage, use a silicone rubber seal like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TY28LZV).

## **Jar Sizes** üè∫  
Ensure the jar mouth matches standard dimensions.  
![Jar sizes](img/img_jarSizes.jpg ':class=image-50 center')  
**_Figure:_** Jar size options: 1/2 cup and 2 cup.

## **Spray Nozzle Setup**  
This two-part design requires cutting the dip tube to 130mm.  
![Dip tube length](https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/1789e0103e3ff3923c5b252176b52948/original.jpg ':class=image-50 center')
